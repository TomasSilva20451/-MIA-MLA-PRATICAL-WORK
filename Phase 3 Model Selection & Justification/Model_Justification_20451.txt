3. Model Selection

(a) Baseline Model
The baseline model used in this work is Logistic Regression.
This model was selected because it is simple, easy to interpret, and commonly used as a reference model in classification problems, especially in financial risk assessment. 
Logistic Regression provides probability outputs and allows an initial understanding of how well the problem can be solved using a linear and interpretable approach.


(b) Models Considered
In addition to the baseline model, the following machine learning models were considered and evaluated:
	•	Decision Tree, due to its interpretability and ability to model non linear relationships
	•	Random Forest, as an ensemble method that reduces overfitting and improves predictive performance
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM), capable of handling complex decision boundaries
	•	Naive Bayes, a simple probabilistic classifier used for comparison
	•	K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), an instance based method suitable for standardized numerical features
	•	Gradient Boosting, an ensemble technique known for strong performance on structured data

Neural Networks were not considered at this stage because they require more data and tuning and offer lower interpretability, which is less suitable for an academic financial risk context.


(c) Model Choice Justification
After comparing the models using cross validation on the training data, Random Forest was selected as the final model.
This choice was justified by its strong performance on tabular financial data, robustness to noise and outliers, and its ability to capture non linear relationships between financial indicators. 
Additionally, Random Forest provides feature importance measures, which improve model interpretability and support decision making in a financial risk assessment context.

Overall, Random Forest offered the best balance between predictive performance, robustness, and interpretability, making it the most appropriate model for this problem.
